## Mental fatigue and decision making {.center}

# Introduction / Background {.scrollable}

1. Mental fatigue can impair core executive functions

2. Decision making as executive function. Important aspect of decision making is risk taking.

3. Does mental fatigue impair risk taking?

4. Initial evidence that it does, 

5. But there is no standard protocol for inducing a transient state of mental fatigue, and (TO DO: check if true) individual working memory capacity not accounted 

5. This study will uses 
  a. recently developed protocol to induce two types of mental fatigue based on small but impactful tweaks of the same activity (Stroop task)
  b. BART to evaluate risk taking
  c. well established complex span tasks to measure working memory capacity, as ability to maintain information in spite of interfering processing
  d. self report measures throughout of mental fatigue and associated concepts (sleepiness, boredom, workload)

6. Previous evidence that computerized (and individualized) fatiguing protocols are effective and induce comparable self-report mental fatigue. Interestingly, despite the similar emntal fatigue, they achieve mental fatigue through different paths (overload, underload)

7. Objectives: 
  a. further evaluation of the fatiguing protocol
  b. does mental fatigue influence risk taking?
  c. does working memory moderate this influence?

:::{.column width=50%}

**Participants** 36 sport science students (18+ years old)

**Design:** Experimental within-subject study. All participants completed risk taking evaluation at baseline (i.e., no fatigue) and then after computerized activities designed to induce either underload fatigue and overload fatigue. Participation involved two days, one for the underload fatigue, and the other for the overload fatigue, in counterbalanced order. Baseline evaluation occurred either on the first or second day, counterbalanced, whereas on the other day, we evaluated participants' pre-fatigue working memory capacity.

# Objectives/hypotheses, analyses, results #1 {.scrollable}

Data-driven hypotheses: 

- 1.1 Our two manipulations successfully induced increased mental fatigue over time
- 1.2 Sleepiness and ...
- 1.3 ...boredom would also increase over time, but more for the underload than overload

Exploratory hypotheses:

- The previous results would be moderated by working memory capacacity, whereby
  - 1.1b the increase in mental fatigue would be steeper for those with smaller working memory capacity, at least for the overload condition
  - 1.2 b
  - 1.3 b

<img src="bart_files/analysis1.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

Analyses: 

- linear mixed models (R, lmer, lmerTest)
- categorical variable contrasts:
  - condition: a two-level variable (0=underload, 1=overload)
  - time: a four level variable (post25, post50, post75, post100) with polynomial contrasts for linear, quadratic, and cubic trends
- working memory capacity mean centered

Interpretations:

- baseline mental fatigue is positively associated with mental fatigue experienced at later stages, whereby individuals starting with a larger score reported larger scores for the later stages
- positive liner and negative quadratic trends for underload indicating overall increase with levelling off (inverted-U)
- trends were not different for overload
- when including working memory capacity as predictor:
  - the effects described above persist
  - in addition, for individuals with greater working memory capacity the linear increase in mental fatigue over time in the overload condition is less steep (i.e., having greater working memory capacity attenuates the increase in mental fatigue over time for the overload activity)

Interpretations:

- baseline boredom is positively associated with foredom experienced at later stages, whereby individuals starting with a larger score reported larger scores for the later stages
- underload condition was perceived as more boring than the overload
- positive linear and negative quadratic trends for underload indicating overall increase with levelling off (inverted-U)
- the linear increase over time was less steep for overload than underload; the quadratic trend was also less pronounced for overload 
- when including working memory capacity as predictor:
  - the effects described above persist, with similar magnitude
  - in addition, for people with greater working memory capacity the linear increase in boredom over time for underload becomes steeper (with no difference in steepiness for overload). (i.e., having greater working memory capacity amplifies the linear increase over time for underload and no evidence of different effect for overload)



# Objectives/hypotheses, analyses, results #1 cont {.scrollable}

Data-driven hypotheses:

- 1.4 Overload activity would be associated with greater workload than underload
- 1.5 Both activities would have larger ratings for mental demands (etc) than physical demands, and this difference would be larger for overload

Exploratory hypotheses

- The previous effects would be more pronounced for people with lower working memory capacity, but just in the overload activity (i.e., those with lower working memory capacity rate the go-nogo task as more difficult)

Figure: individual workload factors

<img src="bart_files/analysis3b.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

Analyses:

- linear mixed models (R, lmer, lmerTest)
- categorical variable contrasts:
  - condition: a two-level variable (0=underload, 1=overload)
  - NASA factors: a six level variable with reference category = physical demands (where we expect no demands, and whatever effect is likely to be non-factor-specific effect of factor)
- working memory capacity mean centered

Interpretations:

- workload was rated substantially higher (ca. 55 points/100) in the overload activity (go-nogo stroop) than underload activity (contruent stroop)
- working memory capacity does not moderate this relation (i.e., the workload difference between overload and underload was maintained regardless of working memory capacity), 
  - however, individual intercept only were used and individual slopes were not included (i.e., the model did not converge towards a solution)

Interpretations

- Physical demands were rated lower than all other factors. But physical demands are not 0 (see intercept ca 9.8/100) liekely reflecting some aspecific effect of workload (i.e., non specific to any factor). This justifies its use as reference category (let's regress out the effect of physical demands from the other predictors)
- Physical demands were rated higher for overload than underload (despite in both cases they were sitting at a computer). This might reflect that the aspecific workload was greater for overload than underload. It is not feasible that there were really greater physical demands.
- The gap between physical demands and each other factor is much greater for overload (ca. 30-50 points / 100)
- Working memory capacity does not predict or moderate any of the above relationships (i.e., the previous effects) occur regardless of working memory capacity

Interpretations:

- the prospects of ending the task sooner was a substantial source of incentive (see intercept for underload and lack of interaction for lack of evidence of difference in overload)
- this motive was scored higher than two others (...2...5...) but not others (...3...4...)
- the condition did not predict or moderate the previous effects (good: in fact, these questions were asked after being explained the adaptive feature but before knowing whether the upcoming activity would be adaptive or not)

2.1 Overload fatigue would be associated with lower accuracy than underload fatigue (only for trial type common to both conditions: congruent go)

Interpretations:

- analysis 2.1 equivalent to a paired sample t-test
- accuracy for congruent go trials 24.53% higher in underload (93%) than overload. Massive difference in trials that are exactly the same perceptually and expected outcome. the only difference is context whereby in the overload, they had to also evaluate whether the trial was go or nogo, and the trial might have gotten faster over time (to be evaluated below)
- working memory capacity does not moderate the effect (in line with the fact that the difference between over- and underload adjust for each participant and adapt over time to meet their ability and resources)

Interpretations:

- Median response times: ca 516 ms for underload and ca 40 ms slower in overrload --> Overload is adaptive but also more difficult therefore requiring more time

Interpretations:

- underload activity taking about 1917 seconds, and overload activity about 239 seconds less
- despite response times for each trial being longer for overload, overall task duration was shorter for overload, suggesting that the adaptive feature makes so there are no "empty" gaps in the trial sequence (expected due to the adaptive pacing)
- working memory does not moderate this effect (also expected due to individualized and adaptive pacing)

- 3.2 Mental fatigue induced through computerized activities would alter decision time
- 3.1b and 3.2b working memory capacity could moderate previous effects (e.g., the effect of greater mental fatigue on greater risk-taking would be stronger for individuals with lower working memory capacity)

Interpretations

- the financial incentive at baseline was substantial (see intercept). no evidence for any different under fatigue
- all other incentives were scored significantly lower that that one (negative coefficients), at baseline. 
- the gap between financial incentive and motives ...2... and ...5... became bigger (negative coefficients even more negative), under fatigue


3.2 number of pumps for unexploded balloons

Interpretations:

3.3 decision times for unexploded balloons



Interpretations:
- overall, the five motive scores did not differ ahead of the fatiguing tasks
- the prospects of ending the task sooner was, regardless of the fatiguing task to be completed, rated more highly than other motives: motive2 (TO DO: whichever that was) and motive5 (whichever that was). So knowing the task would end sooner if performing well served as a source of incentive to perform well, although other factors provided similar incentive intensity.

The five motives' scores ahead of each bart session

<img src="bart_files/analysis7.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

Interpretations:
- overall motive scores did not differ significantly as a function of condition
- financial motive was scored higher than any other motive
- the difference in score between financial motive and motive2 (TO DO: which one) and motive5 (TO DO: which one) become larger when comparing fatigue conditions vs baseline



# hypothesis 8, analysis, results, and interpretation {.scrollable}

Mental fatigue induced through computerized activities will increase risk taking behaviour (number of pumps for unexploded balloons)


Analysis:

- type: linear mixed models 
- software: R with lmer and lmerTest
- dataset: "BART_subjLvl_long" to have only trials with unexploded balloons
- contrasts:
  - condition: a three-level variable (basleine, overload, underload) with contrasts 1: atRest vs mean(overload, underload) and 2: overload vs underload
  - formula:

```
nPumps ~ condition + trial + (1|subjID)

Interpretations:

- over multiple trials, the number of pumps in unexploded balloons increased, to indicate a possible learning effect
- while controlling for the previous effect, the number of pumps on unexploded balloons was greater after completing the fagitue inducing activity (whichever) compared to the baseline
- in addition, number of pumps greater after the underload than overload

Interpretations:

- decision (to pump) times were longer after fatiguing task (whichever) compared to baseline
- decision times were shorter after underload than underload


Further post-hoc analyses to help the interpretation: how much of the previous effect is attributable to the relation between decsion time and how much the balloon has been pumped?

Interpretations:

- decision time was faster and faster until reaching about 30 pumps (which was indeed half way) and then went slower and slower
- when controlling for the effect above decision time went slower across trials
- while controlling for both the above, the greater decision time after fatigue (whichever) persisted in fact it became stronger. Whereas the underload-overload effect lost significance indicating it could partly be atttributed to the association between num of npums and decision times
