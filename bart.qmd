## Mental fatigue and decision making {.center}

# Introduction / Background

1. Mental fatigue can impair core executive functions

2. Decision making (risk taking) as executive function

# Objectives and hypotheses {.scrollable}

1. Both computerized activities would induce an increase in self-report mental fatigue over time

1. Underload fatigue would be associated with greater boredom and sleepiness than overload fatigue

1. Overload fatigue would be associated with greater workload than underload, and particularly in the factors associated with mental aspects of the activity

1. The prospects of ending the task sooner would be more of an incentive in the overload-fatigue task than in the underload-fatigue task

1. Overload fatigue would be associated with lower accuracy and faster response times than underload fatigue

1. Overload fatigue activity would be faster than underload fatigue (despite involving the same number of trials and due to the its adaptive feature)

1. Mental fatigue induced through computerized activities will decrease motivation to perform the decision-making activity.

1. Mental fatigue induced through computerized activities will increase risk taking behaviour (number of pumps for unexploded balloons)

1. (exploratory). Mental fatigue induced through computerized activities would alter decision time

- (to be included): the moderation of working memory capacity: whereby the effect of greater mental fatigue on greater risk-taking would be stronger for individuals with lower working memory capacity


# Method

- **Participants** 36 sport science students (18+ years old)

- **Design:** Experimental study with repeated-measure three-level assessment of risk taking: no fatigue, underload fatigue, overload fatigue.  

- **Procedure:** 
  - Two visits per participant, each lasting 90–120 minutes.  
  - ... diagram ... TO DO
  - ... description of each activity ... TO DO
  - Competitive incentive: top 3 scorers receive cash prizes (£30, £15, £5).

- workload was greater for overload than underload
- due to greater mental related factors
