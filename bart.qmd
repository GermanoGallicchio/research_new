## Mental fatigue and decision making {.center}

# Introduction / Background

1. Mental fatigue can impair core executive functions

2. Decision making (risk taking) as executive function

# Objectives and hypotheses {.scrollable}

1. Both computerized activities would induce an increase in self-report mental fatigue over time

1. Underload fatigue would be associated with greater boredom and sleepiness than overload fatigue

1. Overload fatigue would be associated with greater workload than underload, and particularly in the factors associated with mental aspects of the activity

1. The prospects of ending the task sooner would be more of an incentive in the overload-fatigue task than in the underload-fatigue task

1. Overload fatigue would be associated with lower accuracy and faster response times than underload fatigue

1. Overload fatigue activity would be faster than underload fatigue (despite involving the same number of trials and due to the its adaptive feature)

1. Mental fatigue induced through computerized activities will decrease motivation to perform the decision-making activity.

1. Mental fatigue induced through computerized activities will increase risk taking behaviour (number of pumps for unexploded balloons)

1. (exploratory). Mental fatigue induced through computerized activities would alter decision time

- (to be included): the moderation of working memory capacity: whereby the effect of greater mental fatigue on greater risk-taking would be stronger for individuals with lower working memory capacity

Figure: individual workload factors

![](bart_files/analysis3b.png)




Interpretations:

- overall workload (NASA-TLX weighted score) was greater for overload than underload
- analysis of the inddividual factors revealed that 
  - all factors were scored more highly in the overload than underload
  - all other factors were scored greater than physical demands (which served as comparison--we expected no physical demand in a computer task)
  - the differences between physical demand and each other score were larger for overload
- therefore, overload = greater workload across various domains and especially due to mental demands (sanity check)

Interpretations:

- participants felt motivated by the prospects of earning money in a manner that was _not_ different from other sources of motivation
- overall, motivation to perform well (whatever the reason) was lower after completing the fatigue-inducing activity (whichever), with no difference between overload and underload

Mental fatigue induced through computerized activities will increase risk taking behaviour (number of pumps for unexploded balloons)


Analysis:

- type: linear mixed models 
- software: R with lmer and lmerTest
- dataset: "BART_subjLvl_long" to have only trials with unexploded balloons
- contrasts:
  - condition: a three-level variable (basleine, overload, underload) with contrasts 1: atRest vs mean(overload, underload) and 2: overload vs underload
  - formula:

```
nPumps ~ condition + trial + (1|subjID)

Interpretations:

- over multiple trials, the number of pumps in unexploded balloons increased, to indicate a possible learning effect
- while controlling for the previous effect, the number of pumps on unexploded balloons was greater after completing the fagitue inducing activity (whichever) compared to the baseline
- in addition, number of pumps greater after the underload than overload

Interpretations:

- decision (to pump) times were longer after fatiguing task (whichever) compared to baseline
- decision times were shorter after underload than underload


Further post-hoc analyses to help the interpretation: how much of the previous effect is attributable to the relation between decsion time and how much the balloon has been pumped?

Interpretations:

- decision time was faster and faster until reaching about 30 pumps (which was indeed half way) and then went slower and slower
- when controlling for the effect above decision time went slower across trials
- while controlling for both the above, the greater decision time after fatigue (whichever) persisted in fact it became stronger. Whereas the underload-overload effect lost significance indicating it could partly be atttributed to the association between num of npums and decision times
